# Introduction:
## Programming an H-bridge with Arduino
# Requirements:
Arduino
 Battery
 Breadboard
 H-bridge component (L293)

# implementation Steps:
1. Activate the battery and set it to 12 volts.
2. Connect the power pins of the H-bridge component to the battery through the breadboard.
3. Connect the ground pins of the H-bridge component to the battery through the breadboard.
4. Connect the output pins 2 and 1 of the H-bridge to the first DC motor.
5. Connect the output pins 3 and 4 of the H-bridge to the second DC motor.
6. After connecting the batteries to the DC motors, we now need to connect the Arduino to these components.

# In the H-bridge component, there are 6 pins:
- 4 pins are for the Input
- 2 pins are for speed control

## I have connected all the Input pins to the Arduino pins (8, 12, 13) and the speed control pins to the Arduino pins (9, 11, 10).
## After that, I have written the code to be able to control the motors.
